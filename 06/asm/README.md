# Assembler #
An assembler which converts programs written in the HACK assembly language to machine code readable by the HACK computer. Project 6 in the NAND2Tetris course (see repo root for more info).

# Development Process #

Dev Phase 1
--------
Make an assembler which translates any assembly-code which doesn't include symbols. Testing the assembler's output of phase1-test.txt against phase1-compare.txt (using UNIX diff).

Dev Phase 2
--------
Complete the assembler so that it can translate any assembly-code, including code with labels, variables and register symbols. Testing assembler's output of phase2-test.txt against phase2-compare.txt (using UNIX diff).

Dev Phase 3
--------
Refactor and clean up the code. Make sure assembler still passes phase 1 and 2 tests.
