# Virtual Machine #
Implementation of a VM which translates from an intermediary VM language to the HACK assembly language. Represents the projects for Week 7 and 8 of the NAND2Tetris course (see repo root for more info).

(✓ means that the test stage has been passed)

# Test-driven Development Process #

Dev Phase 1 : Stack Arithmetic
--------
Implement nine stack arithmetic and logical commands of the VM language and the 'push constant x' command.

Test file 1 (SimpleAdd): pushes and adds two constants. ✓

Test file 2 (StackTest): Executes a series of arithmetic and logical operations on the stack. ✓

Dev Phase 2 : Memory Access
--------
Full implementation of the VM language's push and pop commands and handling of all eight memory segments.

Test file 1 (BasicTest) : Executes pop and push operations using the virtual memory segments. ✓

Test file 2 (PointerTest) : Executes pop and push operations using the 'pointer', 'this' and 'that' segments. ✓

Test file 3 (Static Test) : Executes pop and push operations using the static segment. ✓ 

Dev Phase 3 : Program Flow
--------
Implementation of program flow commands.

Test file 1 (BasicLoop) : Computes 1 + 2 + ... + n, to test implementation of goto and if-goto commands.

Test file 2 (Fibonacci) : Computes the first n elements of the Fibonacci series. More intensive testing of branching commands.

Dev Phase 4 : Function Calling
--------
Implementation of function call processing (setting up stack frames, return values, bootstrapping, etc.).

Test file 1 (SimpleFunction) : Calls a simple math function and returns the result.

Test file 2 (FibonacciElement) : A full test of the function calling, bootstrap section, and most other VM commands. Split into multiple .vm files to test the translation of multiple .vm files to one .asm file.

Test file 3 (StaticsTest) : A full test of the VM implementation's handling of static variables. Again split into multiple .vm files.
