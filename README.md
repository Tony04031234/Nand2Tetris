# Nand2Tetris
My solutions to the problem sets in the NAND2Tetris course (http://www.nand2tetris.org). Each folder represents a distinct problem set. Unless explicitly stated, all of the contents, except the header comments from the NAND2Tetris staff, are my own work.

The course guides "students and self-learners through the construction of a modern, full-scale computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up" (http://www.nand2tetris.org/about.php). 

The course starts with constructing elementary logic chips using NAND gates, before moving to the construction and interconnection of (simulated) hardware components such as registers, RAM, program counters, ALUs, CPUs, and memory-maps, through to assembly language and the construction of an assembler, virtual machines, compilation and the construction of a compiler, and finishing with a high-level programming language and operating system. The end result is a simulated von Neumann architecture computer with a keyboard input and monitor output, running programs written in a created high-level language, every part of which -- both hardware and software -- constructed through the problem sets using the materials of the week before.
